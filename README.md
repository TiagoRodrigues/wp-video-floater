<h2> Description </h2>

[WP Video Floater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-video-floater/) WordPress Plugin allows you to insert a video on the page and, as the user scrolls the page, the video will be pushed to the bottom-right. Works with OptimizePress Embed videos too.

<h3> Key features</h3>
- Sell more! Allows your visitor to watch your video and see your content at the same time.
- You don't have to edit source code of your template to insert any code.
- No coding, just 2 easy steps and you'll have an awesome page!

 To use it you'll need to add a class to the iframe that you want to scroll and add the shortcode below to anywhere in the page.
